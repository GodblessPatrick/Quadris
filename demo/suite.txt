score	# complete 5 O blocks (level0~4 respectively), 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + (4 + 2) ^ 2 = 91
obstacle# start at level 4, an obstacle erases a row, 3 * (4 + 1) ^ 2 + (4 + 1) ^ 2 = 100 (2 I blocks, 1 obstacle block, 1 row)
hint1	# a hint can rotate 
hint2	# a hint can move from right to left and complete a row
hint3	# a hint can move from left to right and try to minimize the height of the highest cell of it
hint4	# a hint will try to minimize number of unreachable cells
norandom# the command will apply after two blocks (undropped and next block)
